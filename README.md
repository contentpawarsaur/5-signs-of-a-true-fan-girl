# 5-signs-of-a-true-fan-girl

There is a HUGE difference between a true fangirl and a “she think she was” a fangirl. Just because someone says they like a certain group, doesn’t mean they are a fan. A lot confuse their sudden infatuation to a certain group or artist for being a certified fan, but being a true diehard fangirl is more than just sudden feeling.

<br<br>>Only true fans will feel guilty when they read on my list. Now, if one of these traits don’t define you, either you’re a bandwagon or you’re just not into whoever you are being a fan yet.

<br><br><strong>You probably spend most of your allowance to fan merchandise.</strong>
You may seem to treat their merchandise as a necessity more than food. It seems like it is okay to you to starve at school as long as you have the latest printed shirt that has a digitized signature of him (or them). You would probably die or you may feel you’ve to ruin your life if you didn’t avail it (not to mention your wardrobe full of their merchandise)

I was like this before, it came to the point that my mom is about to send me to a local rehab center at our town because I hoard a lot of kpop merchandise and she thinks I’ve got a serious hoarding problem. (seriously -_-)

<strong>Bonus</strong>: for kpop fans out there, especially those people whose bias are BTS You can get the <a href="https://www.bibimboxkorea.com">Latest BTS Merch Here.</a> They offer great designs and high-quality items that you’ll surely love.

<br><br><strong>It makes you mad when someone talks negatively about them</strong>
You treat your idols like a spouse: you’ll be with them for better or for worse. True fans will embrace everything about their biases (or idols) even their weaknesses.

So if you are only loving them because they were trending but you suddenly left them because they aren’t popular anymore, then I guess you are only a bandwagon fan.

<br><br><strong>You never miss any of their gigs, concerts, and news.</strong>
You’re like the (insert idol name here) police district, and if possible you’ll definitely hire a private intelligence to see what they are doing on a daily basis. Yes, that’s how much you love them, or in the normal people terms how obsessed you are.

But hey! That’s not a bad thing, in fact, experts say that <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/inverse/why-being-a-fan-is-good-for-you_b_8339938.html">being a fan is good for you.</a> Besides, in not against the law, so don’t fret!

<br><br><strong>You always talk about them</strong>
Ever notice your friend will either walk away or roll her eyes if you’ll start to talk about your bias? It’s because you are doing it most of the time.

<br><br><strong>You ever dreamed to be a part of their life.</strong>
There’s that moment where you are not contented with being a fan. You are wishing that you should be more than it, like to be her sibling or spouse, because you believe it will be an honor if you did become like that
